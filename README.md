# doctor-finder
This project involves developing a Streamlit app that scrapes data from "Practo" using Beautiful Soup. Users input location and specialist to retrieve and display doctor's details, including names, clinics, experience, and patient recommendations. The user-friendly interface ensures easy access to this information.
